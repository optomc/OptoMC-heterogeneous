# OptoMC-heterogeneous.


Mesh-based (heterogeneous) Monte Carlo Simulation with Direct Photon Flux Recording Strategy for Optogenetics.

To run the program below you need an additional iso2mesh MATLAB toolbox for meshing and visualization (http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net).

This version includes a rodent brain model and a four-layer tissue model, and the heterogeneous models are made of mesh.
The four-layer  tissue model is intended to compare our model to the results of MCML.



To run the code for the four-layered tissue model, please excute:  'optomc_fourLayer.m'

To run the code for the rodent brain model, please excute:  'optomc_rat.m'

To visualize precomputed results for the rodent brain model, please excute:  'visualization.m'
